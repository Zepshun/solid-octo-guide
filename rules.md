# X-Team 34 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will talk with each other on our various masteries of different areas, and delegate accordingly, provided that the workload is evenly dispersed.


## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will utilize a group message and give ourselves/each other mini-deadlines to hold each other accountable while also working at a 
reasonable and considerate pace.


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If one of us is struggling with an area, as long as we gave it our all and we are stuck, it's totally fine to ask for help and work
through it together.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will give each other friendly reminders and work together frequently if possible to ensure steady progress on the various assignments.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
We will have clearly defined roles.
We will be willing to share our recources.
We will have frequent, effective communication.
We will have consistent, enthusiastic effort.
